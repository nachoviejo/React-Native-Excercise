# Task tracker  

## Excercise

Please develop a SPA with this simple requirements:   
* Present visually a list of tasks in 3 different states: Planned, In progress, Completed.   
* Each task contains, name, description, estimate and state.   
* The user needs to be able to add/remove and change the state of the tasks.  
* Somewhere in the application you need to present an up to date status, adding up all hours for each state.  
Notes:   
You can assume it's a single user application, and there's no need to store data; but the user needs to be able to add/remove and see tasks.  

Mocking a REST api is suggested.   
You can reuse any existing library, but please distribute the solution with them.   
Write code as you would for production, having in mind that usability is important as well.   

Use react
